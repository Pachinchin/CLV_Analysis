# CLV_Analysis
Here we want to access the CLV of the customers in the customer orders table, of the Tableau superstore dataset. 

First we apply the RFM model then we calculate the Customer live time value.  \
Three methods to be used here are \
Average/Mean Sum\
Cohort Analysis \
BG/NBD Model (with Gamma-Gamma extension)
